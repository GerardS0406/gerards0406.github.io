							<h3><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Developed functionality of towers for the original tower defense aspect (cut) and the current tower aspect</strong></li>
								<li><strong>Developed the buff and debuff system used throughout the game</strong></li>

							<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
							<p>Wicked Wizards is a networked four player cooperative hoard shooter where players are wizards that are trying to take over the world from the good and innocent
								unicorns! Each wizard is armed with a primary attack, an alternate ability, and then an ultimate ability in the fight against the good.
							</p>
							<p>Each player in the game can choose whichever class that they wish to fight with. Whether that's the firepower of the Pyromancer, the strength of the
								Abjurer, or the strategy of the Alchemist, there's a class for everyone to try out! Once selected, players can fight the good as they try to protect the orb
								from the unicorns as the orb wants to corrupt the world.
							</p>
							<p>This project was my senior game capstone project which is a chance for students to showcase all of the work they've done over the course of university with one
								final project. The game started as a prototype which was developed in a previous course in which the group of capstone students at the beginning of the year
								decided on. Wicked Wizards was originally a first person tower defense prototype of the name Wizards of Wizardly.
